# Flask Application Deployment on AWS EC2

This guide outlines the steps to deploy a Flask application on an AWS EC2 instance with Gunicorn and Nginx.

## Step 1: Build a Python Web App using Flask

1. Create a Flask application in your local machine and add the required dependencies to `requirements.txt`.
2. Test the app locally,
```
python3 app.py
```

## Step 2: Create an EC2 instance on AWS

To deploy your Flask application, you need to create an EC2 instance on AWS.

1. **Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**
   - The AMI is the basic unit of deployment and determines the operating system and software pre-installed on the instance.
   - You could select one of the following AMIs: Amazon Linux, macOS, Ubuntu, Windows, Red Hat, and many more.
   - This guide uses **Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type, 64-bit (x86)** as the chosen AMI.
2. **Choose an Instance Type**
   - Instance types define the hardware resources allocated to your instance, such as CPU and memory.
   - For testing and light workloads, choose **t2.micro** or **t3.micro** (eligible for the AWS Free Tier).
   - For production, select an instance type based on your application's performance requirements.
3. **Generate a Key Pair for login**
   - Key pairs provide secure SSH access to your instance.
   - Create a new key pair if you don't already have one and download the `.pem` file. Store it securely as this is required to connect with your instance.
4. **Configure Network Settings**
   - **VPC and Subnet**: Use the default VPC and choose a subnet based on your region.
   - **Security Group**: You can either create a new security group or use an existing security group. Ensure that it has the required inbound and outbound rules for your app.
5. **Configure Storage**
   - Adjust the size of the storage based on your application's needs.

## Step 3: Connect to the EC2 instance

1. Before connecting to the EC2 instance, change the permissions of the `.pem` file to be only read by the owner,
```
chmod 400 path/to/key.pem
```
2. Use SSH to connect to your EC2 instance,
```
ssh -i <your-key.pem> ubuntu@<your-ec2-public-ip>
```

***WinSCP and PuTTY is not required for Linux/MacOS users.***

## Step 4: Transfer Required Files

1. Before transferring the application, modify the Flask app's code to allow it to listen on all network interfaces,
\
\
Replace:
```
app.run(debug=True) 
```
&emsp;&emsp;With:
```
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

2. Use the `scp` command to securely copy your application files to the EC2 instance,
```
scp -i <your-key.pem> -r /path/to/your-app ubuntu@<your-ec2-public-ip>:/home/ubuntu/
```

3. Once the files are transferred, log in to your EC2 instance and navigate to the application's directory,
```
cd /home/ubuntu/your-app
```

## Step 5: Install Required Libraries and Test Your App

1. Update the system and install necessary tools:
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv -y
```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Test the app:
```
python3 app.py
```

5. Visit `http://<your-ec2-public-ip>:5000` to ensure the app is running.

## Step 6: Set Up the App for Production

Flaskâ€™s built-in development server is not suitable for production use as it is not designed to handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently. To set up a production-ready environment, we use two key components:

1. **Web Server (Nginx)**
   - A web server like **Nginx** acts as a reverse proxy, handling incoming requests from the internet.
   - It can manage multiple simultaneous connections, serve static files efficiently, and distribute traffic to your Flask app.
   - Nginx ensures that requests are quickly handled and improves the overall **scalability** and **security** of your application.
\
\
**Install Nginx**
```
sudo apt install nginx -y
```

2. **WSGI Server (Gunicorn)**
   - A **WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface)** server ensures portability between web servers and Python web frameworks.
   - Gunicorn is a lightweight WSGI server that processes requests forwarded by Nginx and passes them to our Flask application.
\
\
**Install Gunicorn**
```
pip install gunicorn
```

3. **Integrate Nginx with Gunicorn**
   - Nginx acts as a reverse proxy, forwarding incoming requests to Gunicorn.
   - Create an Nginx Configuration File,
```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/flask_app
```
Add the following configuration in the above file (replace `<EC2-Public-IP>` with your instance's public IP),
```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name <EC2-Public-IP>;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```
Enable the Configuration and Restart Nginx
```
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/flask_app /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
4. Run Gunicorn
Start the Gunicorn server to serve your Flask app:
```
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
```

Your application is now production-ready and accessible via your EC2 instance's public IP on port 80, that is, `http://<EC2-Public-IP>/`.
